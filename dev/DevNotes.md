Development Notes
=================

Identical to <https://github.com/haukex/simple-perms/blob/main/dev/DevNotes.md> except:
- Documentation:
  - the changelog is at `docs/changelog.rst`
  - no `make README.md`, instead `( cd docs && make clean all )` checks the build,
    the documentation is actually built on *Read the Docs*
  - Check <https://readthedocs.org/projects/igbpyutils/> to make sure docs are building there
  - `git clean -dxf docs/html`
- the module name, of course
